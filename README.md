# Art-Collage
Project in my CS112 (Data Structures Class) 
This project consists of creating an abstract data type called ArtCollage, where a collage of images is created. 
There is a one-argument constructor and a three-argument constructor. 
There are two methods:
- MakeCollage method which makes a collage of pictures
- Change Tile Methods which changes the colors of some tiles within the collage

This project was created for the Data Structures Class at Rutgers University, Spring 2020
